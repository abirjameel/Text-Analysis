# Text-Analysis
## Classification Model for Sentiment Analysis ofÂ Reviews
Text Analysis is an important application of machine learning algorithms. 
Since the raw text or a sequence of symbols cannot be fed directly to the 
algorithms themselves as most of them expect numerical feature vectors with 
proper dimensions rather than the raw text documents which is an example of 
unstructured data. For Classification you will be using Machine Learning 
Algorithms such as Logistic Regression. You will also be using some NLP 
techniques such as count Vectorizer and Term Frequency-Inverse document 
Matrix (TF-IDF).
