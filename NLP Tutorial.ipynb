    "Text Analysis is an important application of machine learning algorithms. Since the raw text or a sequence of symbols cannot be fed directly to the algorithms themselves as most of them expect numerical feature vectors with proper dimensions rather than the raw text documents which is an example of unstructured data. For Classification you will be using Machine Learning Algorithms such as Logistic Regression. You will also be using some NLP techniques such as [count Vectorizer](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/scikit-learn-fake-news) and [Term Frequency-Inverse document Matrix (TF-IDF)](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/scikit-learn-fake-news). You will be using a reviews and ratings data available [here](http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/) but since the data is huge, to make things bit easier for you, use a subset that you can also download from our Github Repo [Github_Repo]().     \n",
    "Okay, so for give it a start you will be following some steps mentioned below:  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data Preparation, In this section you will prepare our data from simple text and ratings to a matrix that is acceptable by Machine Learning Algorithms. \n",
    "2. Applying NLP techniques to extract features out of text such as Tokenization and TF-IDF you will be using [scikit learn](). \n",
    "3. Building a Classification Model. \n",
    "4. Evaluating Model \n",
    "5. Finally Predicting a new review that even you can write by yourself (but beware the words you use in your review should be there in training set, else you will get an Error!)."

Now, the question is how you can define a review to be a positive one or a negative, so for this you are creating a binary variable \"Positively_Rated\" in which 1 signifies a review is Positively rated and 0 means Negative rated, adding it to our dataset.   A simple rule to mark a positive and negative rating can be obtained by selecting rating > 3 as 1 (positively rated) and others as 0 (Negatively rated) removing neutral ratings which is equal to 3."

    "A document-term matrix is a mathematical matrix that describes the frequency of terms that occur in a collection of documents. In a document-term matrix, rows correspond to documents in the collection and columns correspond to terms. There are various schemes for determining the value that each entry in the matrix should take. One such scheme is tf-idf. They are useful in the field of natural language processing. [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document-term_matrix)    \n",
    "When creating a database of terms that appear in a set of documents the document-term matrix contains rows corresponding to the documents and columns corresponding to the terms. For instance if one has the following two (short) documents:  \n",
    "\n",
    "D1 = \"I love dancing\"  \n",
    "D2 = \"I hate dancing\",  \n",
    "then the document-term matrix would be:  \n",
    "\n",
    "|     |I  |love|hate|dancing  |\n",
    "|-----|---|----|----|---------|\n",
    "|D1\t  |1  |1   |0   |1        |\n",
    "|D2\t  |1  |0   |1   |1        |         \n",
    "\n",
    "which shows which documents contain which terms and how many times they appear.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that more sophisticated weights can be used; one typical example, among others, would be tf-idf, you will be using this technique in coming sections.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Now you have tokenized matrix of text document or reviews, you can use Logistic Regression or any other classifier to classify between the Negative and Positive Reviews for the limitation of this tutorial and just to show the intent of text classification and feature extraction techniques let us use logistic regression. Before you do that just have a look how feature matrix look like, using `Vectorizer.transform()` to make a document term matrix. "

    "Which means while building the vocabulary ignore terms that have a document frequency strictly lower than the given threshold, which means not keeping words those do not occur in atleast 5 documents or reviews (in our context), this can be considered as a hyperparmater which directly affects accuracy of your model so you need to do a trial or a grid search to find what value of `min_df` or `max_df` gives best result, again it highly depends on your data. This value is also called cut-off in the literature."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "This Tutorial presents a minimal Text Analysis and classification application to Amazon Unlocked Mobile Reviews, Where you are classifying the labels as Positive and Negative based on the ratings of reviews. For Classification you have used a simple Logistic Regression Classifier to predict a Positive or Negative Review based on the review text, but you can further extend this tutorial using some other Classifier algorithm like Decision Tree or Naive bayes but since with logistic regression and using n-grams feature extraction methods we are getting more than 91% accuracy and just to make this tutorial limited and focussed on text classfication hence it does not require to use any other classifier in this tutorial.
